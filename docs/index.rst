JUMEG
=====

This is a set of tools used for MEEG processing at FZJ.

In no way is this a well rounded usable package but more of a starting point for ideas and a landing point for references.

It is also not well maintained, so use at your own risk. 

Installation
------------

The installation procedure is described `here <https://github.com/jdammers/jumeg#user-installation-quick>`_.
